**Type Banglish and get Bangla instantly - in any Windows application.**

Vampire Keyboard is a multilingual keyboard helper for Windows built for Bangladeshi developers, writers, and everyday users. Type Romanized Bangla (Banglish) anywhere - MS Office, Chrome, VS Code, Notepad - and each word converts to proper Bangla the moment you hit Space. It also supports direct Bangla to English translation, a Bijoy/Avro compatible mode for official work, and 20+ world languages.
